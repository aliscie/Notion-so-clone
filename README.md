# autodox-backend

# Intro

There is nothing better and simpller to add to your resume then twetter clone. But in this app I compine more things which is notions.so clone. I really hate the menu bar where you have to go the the menu bar and selecte insert then select image, but if you can just say `/image` and hit anter that would be much easer, and I beilive that this will be the future of docs even goodl docs may switch to this new way of interacting with docs.
